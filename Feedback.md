drawCircle: Great job. drawTree: Nice drawing. mysteryScript: Great job on all the comments, but you can add a # at the end of each line and add your comment there to make it more readable, rather than write all the comments at the bottom. randomSquares: Great work. search: Good work, but try to make your print statements more descriptive so we know what's being printed out.
